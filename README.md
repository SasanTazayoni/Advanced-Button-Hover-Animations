# Introduction

This project presents an enhanced collection of advanced button hover animations, built with TypeScript to ensure maintainability, scalability, and ease of customisation. Inspired by [Ian Lunn's Hover Effects](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/), this project expands upon traditional hover interactions, offering a diverse set of dynamic animations that can be integrated into any modern web project.

The animations in this collection are designed to elevate user engagement, introducing visual feedback that enhances interactivity and usability. From subtle effects to bold transformations, each animation has been carefully crafted to provide a balance between aesthetics and performance. These effects can be effortlessly applied to buttons, links, or other interactive elements, making them suitable for a variety of UI/UX applications.

This project is built with reusability in mind, allowing developers to easily customise effects, tweak parameters, and extend functionalities to suit their specific needs. By leveraging TypeScript, the animations are structured with strong typing, ensuring better error handling, clearer code organisation, and a smoother development experience.

To experience the animations in action, simply apply them to any button element. Each hover effect is triggered when a user moves their cursor over the button, adding an extra layer of engagement to the user interface. Developers can tweak animation settings such as duration, easing functions, and effect intensity to create unique visual styles.

Comprehensive documentation is included to ensure that users can easily implement, adjust, and maintain the animations. The instructions will detail how each effect functions, how to apply them to different elements, and how to modify styles while preserving the smooth and intended animations.

This collection caters to a broad audience, from frontend developers and UI/UX designers to enthusiasts who appreciate interactive and aesthetically pleasing web elements. The variety of effects ensures that whether you prefer sleek and minimal animations or bold, attention-grabbing transformations, there’s an option to fit your project’s style.
